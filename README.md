Loan Amortization Schedule Calculator 
======================

Given a loan amount, term, and annual interest rate calculate the monthly payment, total interest paid, and create an amortization table. Interest is compounded monthly which is typical of most loans: mortgage, car, small business, etc. 

The calculator has additional styling to make it print-friendly and works well on mobile devices.  It is written in Javascript and updates when an input is changed for a faster experience.
